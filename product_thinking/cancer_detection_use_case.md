# Day 5 – Cancer Detection Use Case (ML in Healthcare)

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Early detection of cancer significantly improves treatment outcomes and survival rates. However, radiologists and pathologists often face large volumes of diagnostic images or test results, leading to time pressure and variability in interpretation.

We aim to build a machine learning model that flags **high-risk tumor cases**, helping clinicians prioritize which cases to review more closely. The model will act as a **decision support tool**, not a final diagnosis system.

## 🧪 Available Data Signals

- Medical imaging data (MRI, CT scans, X-rays)
- Pathology lab results (biopsy cell data)
- Tumor size, shape, texture, and density
- Blood test indicators
- Family history, age, gender
- Historical labels: benign vs malignant

---

## ⚙️ Non-ML Baseline

- Manual review of all cases by radiologists
- Based on individual judgment, time availability, and experience

✅ Human expertise  
❌ Inconsistent, time-consuming, and not scalable

## 🤖 ML-Based Approach

### Model Type:
- **Binary classifier** → Predicts “High-risk” or “Low-risk”

### Possible Models:
- Logistic regression (baseline)
- Random forest / XGBoost (tabular data)
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs for imaging data)
- Ensemble of structured + image features

## 📈 Key Product Metrics

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Recall (sensitivity)** | Must catch as many cancer cases as possible |
| **Precision** | Avoid unnecessary follow-up procedures or patient panic |
| **F1 Score** | Balance both precision and recall to guide clinical trust |
| **False negative rate** | Critical to monitor; missing a real case is high-risk |
| **Time-to-flag** | How fast can a case be elevated to a doctor’s attention |

---

## ⚖️ Precision vs Recall Trade-Off

- **Recall is non-negotiable**: You can’t miss cancer
- **Precision must be reasonable**: Too many false positives may overwhelm clinicians and reduce trust
- **F1 Score is often used** to track overall model health and guide product decisions

## 🛡️ Risk & Compliance Considerations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| False negatives (missed cancer) | Conservative model thresholds, mandatory human review |
| False positives | Alert calibration, clear UX to show model confidence |
| Regulatory exposure (FDA, CE) | Documented validation, human-in-the-loop enforcement |
| Data privacy (HIPAA/GDPR) | Encrypted storage, limited access to PII, audit trails |
| Model drift (changing populations) | Scheduled retraining, performance monitoring dashboards |

## 🧭 PM Strategy

- Phase 1: Use model in “silent mode” to flag cases without surfacing to users
- Phase 2: Show flags + confidence levels to internal clinical teams only
- Phase 3: Integrate into full diagnostic review workflows with clinician sign-off
- Build dashboards for model confidence, cohort-wise recall, and flagged case impact
- Document model behavior for regulatory,
