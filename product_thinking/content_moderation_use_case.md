# Day 6 ‚Äì Content Moderation Use Case (ML for UGC Platforms)

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

User-generated content (UGC) platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit must protect their communities from harmful content such as hate speech, violence, misinformation, and harassment.

Manual moderation does not scale at platform-level volumes.  
We aim to build an ML-based system that flags harmful content automatically to assist human moderators.

---

## üìä Available Data Signals

- Text content (posts, comments, captions)
- Image/video metadata (tags, object detection)
- Historical flagging or reporting behavior
- User trust scores or community reputation
- Posting velocity (sudden spike in activity)
- Geolocation and device metadata (optional, privacy-checked)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-ML Baseline

- Manual moderation queues
- Simple rule-based filtering (e.g., keyword blocklists)
- Community reporting (users flag bad content)

‚úÖ Effective for clear cases  
‚ùå Slow, reactive, doesn't catch subtle violations or new threats

---

## ü§ñ ML-Based Approach

### Model Type:
- **Multilabel classifier**  
  (e.g., one post can be "hate speech" + "spam" simultaneously)

### Model Candidates:
- Text classification (NLP models: fine-tuned BERT, RoBERTa)
- Image moderation (CNNs trained for object/scene detection)
- Ensemble models: combine text + image + metadata signals

## üìà Key Product Metrics

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Recall** | Catch as much harmful content as possible (safety first) |
| **Precision** | Avoid over-flagging good content (trust and usability) |
| **F1 Score** | Balanced health check between catching bad and avoiding false positives |
| **Moderation latency** | Time from posting to action (needs to be fast) |
| **Appeal success rate** | How often wrongly flagged content wins appeal (proxy for precision)

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Precision vs Recall Trade-Off

- **Recall Priority**: It‚Äôs better to flag more potentially harmful content upfront ‚Äî **user safety** and **regulatory compliance** depend on it.
- **Precision Risk**: Over-flagging can cause censorship complaints, creator dissatisfaction, legal risks.

### PM Decision:
Start with a bias toward **high recall**, with human review layers for flagged content before takedown.

## üõ°Ô∏è Product Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Over-blocking good content (censorship claims) | Review queue with fast human escalation |
| Missing harmful content | Aggressive retraining, feedback loops from moderators |
| Bias in models (language, culture) | Diverse training datasets, fairness audits |
| Latency too high for live moderation | Lightweight models with staged escalation |

---

## üß≠ PM Strategy

- Phase 1: "Shadow mode" ‚Äî model flags but humans moderate manually
- Phase 2: Assistive mode ‚Äî prioritize human queues based on ML risk scores
- Phase 3: Automated soft actions (e.g., demotion) for very high-risk content
- Phase 4: Direct action (removal) only after high model confidence + policy calibration

Document everything for transparency: thresholds, appeals, retraining triggers.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

Content moderation at scale is one of the hardest ML applications ‚Äî  
It‚Äôs **safety-critical**, **trust-sensitive**, and **ethically complex**.

As a PM:
- **Recall protects users and brand reputation.**
- **Precision protects content creators and freedom of expression.**
- **Continuous retraining and transparent governance** are key to long-term success.
