# Day 8 ‚Äì Fraud Detection ML System Architecture

---

## üéØ Objective

Design a real-time fraud detection system for a payment platform that can score transactions, flag suspicious activity, and take action ‚Äî all with minimal latency.

---

## üõ† Data Inputs

- **Transaction metadata**: Amount, timestamp, location, merchant ID
- **Device information**: IP address, device fingerprint, browser metadata
- **Historical behavior**: Past user transactions, flagged fraud incidents
- **External risk scores**: Third-party fraud intelligence sources (optional)

---

## üß† Model Architecture

| Step | Component |
|-----|-----------|
| 1 | **Feature Store**: Maintains pre-computed features for transactions |
| 2 | **Real-Time Scoring Service**: Receives live transaction data and scores it using ML model |
| 3 | **Decision Engine**: Applies business logic based on model risk score (e.g., block, alert, review) |

- **Model Type**: Binary classifier (fraud = 1, legitimate = 0)
- **Algorithms**: Random Forest, XGBoost, or lightweight ensemble
- **Latency Target**: Response under 200 milliseconds

---

## ‚ö° Serving Infrastructure

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Load Balancer** | Distributes incoming transaction scoring requests |
| **Auto-scaling API Servers** | Scale ML inference endpoints up/down based on traffic |
| **Caching Layer (Optional)** | For frequent customers or merchants to reduce re-scoring |

---

## üìà Monitoring and Metrics

- **Precision** (to avoid flagging too many legitimate users)
- **Recall** (to catch maximum real fraud)
- **False positive rate**
- **Model drift detection** (e.g., new fraud patterns)
- **Latency metrics** for scoring API

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Controls and Fallbacks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| False positives (good users blocked) | Soft block first + human review queue |
| Missing true fraud (false negatives) | Conservative thresholds, ensemble stacking |
| Model degradation over time | Retraining on latest fraud patterns every 30‚Äì60 days |
| Server downtime | Graceful fallback to rule-based engine or manual review escalation |

---

## üß≠ PM Strategy

- **Phase 1**: Silent Mode ‚Äî ML flags transactions but no automated action yet (monitor precision/recall).
- **Phase 2**: Assist Mode ‚Äî ML risk score assists human fraud review teams.
- **Phase 3**: Autonomous Mode ‚Äî High-confidence transactions auto-blocked or flagged for soft review.
- **Continuous Iteration**: Use post-deployment data to retrain and tune thresholds.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

A high-performing fraud detection system must:
- Respond within strict latency limits
- Catch fraud reliably without harming good users
- Continuously evolve to counter new fraud tactics

As an ML PM, your role is to:
- Balance **safety**, **trust**, and **customer experience**
- Design for **monitoring**, **fallbacks**, and **governance**
- Treat the ML system as a **dynamic risk-management engine**, not a static model
