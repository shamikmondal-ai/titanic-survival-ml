# Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.

We use basic data preprocessing, feature engineering, and two classification models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

The goal is to explore model evaluation metrics beyond accuracy and understand the trade-offs between precision, recall, and F1 score.

## ðŸ§° Technologies and Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization later)

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

- **Model Evaluation**: Using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score to assess models properly
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Handling underfitting and overfitting
- **Feature Engineering**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables
- **Explainability**: Analyzing feature importances in Random Forest
- **Production Thinking**: Architecting ML systems for real-world applications

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | ~78% | ~73% | ~66% | ~69% |
| Random Forest | ~81% | ~76% | ~72% | ~74% |

(Note: Numbers may vary slightly depending on random train/test split.)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search / Random Search)
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Model deployment with Flask or Streamlit (later stages)
- Build end-to-end MLOps pipeline
